# Calendy: Scan it. Save it.

## ðŸ“Œ Overview
Have you ever walked past an event poster, thought it looked interesting, took a picture but then completely forgot about it? We all have, and now that image is gathering dust in our Photos app. Manually adding event details to your calendar is a hassleâ€”and thatâ€™s where **Calendy** comes in.

With a quick scan, **Calendy** reads the poster and automatically creates a calendar entry, saving the event name, date, time, and location. No typing, no forgetting, no stress. Just **scan and go**.

### âœ¨ Features
- **Instant Poster Scanning** â€“ Extracts event details from posters using OCR.
- **Seamless Calendar Integration** â€“ Saves events directly to your preferred calendar.
- **Minimal & Intuitive UI** â€“ No unnecessary features; just scan and save.
- **Works Offline** â€“ Capture events even when you're not connected.
- **Smart Reminders** â€“ Never miss an event again.

Whether youâ€™re a student, a professional, or someone who loves discovering new events, **Calendy** keeps your plans organized with zero effort.
